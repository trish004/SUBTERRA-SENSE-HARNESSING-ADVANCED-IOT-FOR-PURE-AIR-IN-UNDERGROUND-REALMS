## 📘 Project Overview

**Subterra Sense** is an IoT-powered real-time air quality monitoring system specifically designed for underground mining environments. 
The project addresses the urgent need to detect hazardous air pollutants (including gases and dust) that often go unnoticed until it's too late.
Traditional systems fall short on real-time detection — this system integrates sensors, Arduino Uno, and data visualization tools to offer 
**instant alerts and historical analysis**, increasing safety and awareness for miners.
